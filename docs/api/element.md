# `Element`

An `Element` represents a WPF element within the current application visual tree. It can be interacted with and queried in all expected ways. An element is accessible via `GetElement(s)` on the `AppDriver` class.

The properties of an `Element` are automatically updated whenever there is a change in the application's state. For example, if additional text is entered into a field, the value of `input["Text"]` will be updated accordingly.

## Methods

----
`Element Click()`

Issues a full `Click` event using the left mouse button on the underlying WPF element, including `PreviewMouseDown`, `MouseDown` and then `PreviewMouseUp` and `MouseUp`. The `MouseDevice` will be properly hooked to read correct mouse down and mouse up values, as well as the `IsMouseOver` property on each element in the visual tree.

⚠️ The mouse position cannot be hooked and should not be relied on to calculate `IsMouseOver`. You may need to refactor your code to use the `IsMouseOver` property directly instead.

The current element is returned to allow chaining methods.

**Usage**
```csharp
element.Click();
```
----
`Element RightClick()`

Issues a full `Click` event using the right mouse button on the underlying WPF element including `PreviewMouseDown`, `MouseDown` and then `PreviewMouseUp` and `MouseUp`. The `MouseDevice` will be properly hooked to read correct mouse down and mouse up values, as well as the `IsMouseOver` property on each element in the visual tree.

⚠️ The mouse position cannot be hooked and should not be relied on to calculate `IsMouseOver`. You may need to refactor your code to use the `IsMouseOver` property directly instead.

The current element is returned to allow chaining methods.

**Usage**
```csharp
element.RightClick();
```
----
`Element DoubleClick()`

Raises a `MouseDoubleClickEvent` on the underlying WPF element using the left mouse button. The `MouseDevice` will be properly hooked to read correct mouse down and mouse up values, as well as the `IsMouseOver` property on each element in the visual tree.

⚠️ The mouse position cannot be hooked and should not be relied on to calculate `IsMouseOver`. You may need to refactor your code to use the `IsMouseOver` property directly instead.

The current element is returned to allow chaining methods.

**Usage**
```csharp
element.DoubleClick();
```
----

The current element is returned to allow chaining methods.

**Usage**
```csharp
element.Focus();
```
----
`Element Select()`

The current element is returned to allow chaining methods.

**Usage**
```csharp
element.Select();
```
----
`Element Expand()`

**Usage**
```csharp
element.Collapse();
```
----
`Element SelectText(string text)`

Finds the given `text` on the underlying WPF element and sets the `SelectionStart` and the `SelectionLength` to match. If the `text` cannot be found, `SelectedText` is set instead, which appends the given `text` on the control and then selects it. If the element is a `TextBox` or the like, subsequent selection changed events will be raised.

The current element is returned to allow chaining methods.

**Usage**
```csharp
element.SelectText("Hello world");
```
----
`Element Check()`

```
----

----
`Element RaiseEvent<TInput>(Expression<Func<TInput, RoutedEventArgs>> code)`

Invokes `RaiseEvent` on the underlying WPF element using the given `code` expression to generate the input `RoutedEventArgs`. If the underlying WPF element does not have any handlers for the given event, and it is a `direct` routed event, it will iterate up the visual tree for a more appropriate target. If it cannot find one, the original element is used. The `MouseDevice` and `IsMouseOver` properties will be properly hooked if a mouse event is raised.

`TInput` specifies the type of the underlying WPF element. `UIElement` can be used if it is irrelevant.

The current element is returned to allow chaining methods.

**Usage**
```csharp
// Raise event with `MouseButtonEventArgs`

    {
        RoutedEvent = Control.MouseDoubleClickEvent,
    });

// Raise event with `TextCompositionEventArgs` on the underlying `TextBox`.
element.RaiseEvent<TextBox>(x => new TextCompositionEventArgs(
    Keyboard.PrimaryDevice,
    new TextComposition(InputManager.Current, x, x.Text + " Append some text!"))
    {

        Source = Keyboard.PrimaryDevice.FocusedElement,
    });
